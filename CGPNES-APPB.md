# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Appendix B - Memory mappers

There are around 100 types of mappers for the NES, each one usually has a name, and each usage of the mapper has been assigned a number by the iNES emulator community.  These numbers are supported by most of the NES emulators.  The mapper names are based on the type of hardware (chipset) the cartridge uses.

Due to the number of different mappers available only the more popular mapper configurations will be shown in detail in this book.
