# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 12 - More enemies

This chapter covers

- Defining more enemy types
- Keeping track of enemies
- Changing our enemy spawn code
- Changing our enemy movement code
- Making our Smart Bomb smarter

So far, our game only has one type of enemy, which always move the same way.  This does not present much challenge to the gamer and does not make the game very interesting.

In this chapter we are going to look at how we define different types of enemies in our game code.  Then we will look at how we will keep track of more information about each enemy, this will allow us to make the enemies move in different directions and patterns and to introduce some animation.
