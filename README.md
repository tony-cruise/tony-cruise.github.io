# Introduction
This is the public support site for the various books and tools that I have published, mostly to support the retro gaming community.
# Programming Games for NES
This is my latest book where I go through the tools and steps need to start writing games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 6502 Assembler.

The Github repository for the book is:
[ProgrammingGamesForTheNES](https://github.com/tony-cruise/ProgrammingGamesForTheNES)

## Learning 6502 Assembler
To support readers learning 6502 Assembly Language I have put together an online 6502 Simulator/Assembler (based on the code of Stian SÃ¸reng's and Nick Morgan) so that readers can see 6502 commands in action before we get to the part where we setup the NES hardware and get something displaying on screen.

Run the [6502 Simulator](/6502Simulator.html).
