# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 16 - Where to from here?

This chapter covers

- Enhancing our Game
- Extending the NES
- Publishing your finished game
- Other types of games

We have put together a simple game over the course of this book, with a few enhancements it could be made more interesting and a much more professional title.

Our sample game covers only one genre of video games i.e., a shoot-em-up, especially with the NES and its extended capabilities there are quite a few other genres that can be achieved on the hardware.

Once you have finished a game, one of the greatest rewards is to see others playing it, whether that be via a free download ROM, sold online or produced in physical form, perhaps even with a proper box and manual.

One of the reasons the NES had such a long life as a console, was that developers could extend the functionality of the console by adding features inside the game cartridge.
