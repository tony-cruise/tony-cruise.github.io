# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Appendix C - Memory and IO map

The NES architecture is based on the 8-bit 6502 CPU which can access 64k of memory at any one time.  The 6502 processor does not have specific instructions to access external ports, so instead uses dedicated memory locations instead the way to read and write to external devices.

This appendix will show the memory map in more detail and list all the memory mapped ports built into the original hardware.
