The Spectravideo and MSX machines are wonderful computers to learn to program. On them with very little effort you can make a TV screen come alive with fantastic colour pictures and make sound burst forth from the TV speakers.

You can also play great games, learn how to program and let the computer teach you other subjects like maths and spelling.

Once disk drives and perhaps a printer are added, they can be used for more serious purposes like storing information and word processing.
