# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 15 - Music

This chapter covers

- Music project structure
- Arpeggios
- Instruments
- Generating music data for our game
- Using music in our game

We have used sound effects to bring our game alive with zap and explosion sounds, but to bring more atmosphere to any games it is also good to add some music.  Music can be played on the title screen or during the game, and change depending on the location or scenario.

The author does not proport to having the ability to create original sounding music, and usually relies on others to supply such things.  But what we will focus on in this chapter is how to use the Famistudio tool to create or adapt music.  We will work with one of the included music examples included with Famistudio.
