# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 11 - Player collisions and lives

This chapter covers

- Handling the player ship colliding with enemies
- Animating the player’s death sequence
- Displaying the current Player’s Lives
- Handling game over

In this chapter we are going to cover handling the collision between the player and enemies, animating the player’s death sequence, displaying the number of lives the player has remaining. Of course, once the player has run out of lives, we need to show “Game Over” on screen. Returning to our game intro screen so the player can view the high score and start a new game.
