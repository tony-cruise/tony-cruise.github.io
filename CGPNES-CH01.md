# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 1 - Let's program games

Starting from the late 1970s with the release of the groundbreaking game “Space Invaders”, video games gained widespread popularity, and whole arcades were dedicated to just offering “Space Invaders” for patrons to enjoy.  Soon a host of other arcade games followed, bringing us classics such as “Donkey Kong”, “Pac-Mman”, “Galaga”, and many, many more.

Riding on this wave of popularity, home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision entered people’s homes, bringing simplified versions of arcade games to consumers. These early consoles (and many home computers) started the process of people gaming at home.  Meanwhile, in Japan, Nintendo, a toy company that had been creating small handheld video game units, entered the market in 1983 with the Famicom (Family Computer).  This small, but quite powerful 8-bit system burst onto the local market and introduced gamers to Super Mario Bros, using the Mario character from the arcade game Donkey Kong, along with a fast horizontal scrolling array of platforms and quirky characters. 

Two years later, the Famicom was re-packaged and re-branded for its release in the U.S. and Canadian United States and Canada markets as the Nintendo Entertainment System.  As well as introducing Super Mario Bros, it introduced the world to new game genres with The Legend of Zelda and Metroid and became one of the best-selling consoles of its time.  The NES continues today to be a very popular “retro” console, with a wide range of games that define what a retro game is in a lot of gamers’ minds.
