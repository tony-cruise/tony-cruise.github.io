# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 5 - Starting somewhere

This chapter covers

- NES code structure and memory configuration
- Initializing the NES hardware
- Loading tile and sprite shape data
- Displaying some text on the screen
- Displaying a bat and a ball using sprites
- Moving the ball and bat around the screen

We are going to create a simple space shooting game throughout the rest of this book, but before we get too carried away, we should start with a simpler demo NES project that provides the basic template for making a game. This demo does all the required setup to get the console up and running, placing some text on the screen and two objects, a ball that bounces around the screen and a bat that is moved via the game controller.
