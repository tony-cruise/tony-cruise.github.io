# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 6 - Starting a game

This chapter covers

- Setting up our game project
- Creating a shared library
- Initializing the console
- How the NES displays background graphics
- Displaying the graphics on both our titles screen and then the main screen of the game

In this chapter, we are going to start making our game, called Mega Blast. This game is based on the Intellivision game Astro Smash, a simple space shooting game with our “hero” ship down at the bottom of the screen and various “enemies” dropping down toward the bottom of the screen
