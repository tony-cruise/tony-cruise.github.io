# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 4 - Math, loops, conditions and bits

This chapter covers

- Letâ€™s do some mMaths.
- Conditions
- Jumps, branches, and calls
- Bytes, bits, and nibbles
- Using the stack

In the last chapter, we covered loading and storing values between the registers in the CPU and memory.  In this chapter, we will look at performing some simple math, at making decisions (conditions), and, jumping to other places in your code, and then finally looking at instructions that help us look at and change individual bits and use the special area of memory used for the stack.
