# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 13 - Animations and more

This chapter covers

- Animating our enemies
- Adding background animation
- Visualizing a bigger explosion when an enemy mine hits the ground
- Progressing to the next level of difficulty

We now have a mostly playable game, but it still lacks excitement and doesnâ€™t really show some of the abilities of the NES hardware. So, we will use this chapter to add some items to make the game more interesting, including animations for both our enemies and the background, both shaking the screen and fast cycling some colors when one of the enemy mines hits the planet's surface and finally allow the player to progress to the next level of difficulty.
