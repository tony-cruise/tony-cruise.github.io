# Classic Game Programming On The NES - Chapter 10 - Keeping score

This chapter covers

- Recording   the player’s points score.
- Adding to the player’s score.
- Subtracting from the player’s score.
- Displaying the score on screen.
- Checking whether the player has beaten the current high score.

In the previous chapter, we added collision detection to our game and detected when our player’s bullet encounters any of our enemy objects, so next we will work through how we keep track of and change the player’s score.

Our Megablast game is based on Astro Smash for the Intellivision, and in that game, you increase your score by shooting various enemies and lose score if any of the enemies make it to the ground.  This is another good reason it makes a good example game, as we get to cover both increasing and decreasing the player’s score.
